## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can use GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability). Simply go to the "Security" tab of this project and click "Report a Vulnerability".

For non-sensitive items, just open an issue.
