# Red Team Assessment Platform (RTAP)

_This is a personal hobby project, with no commitments and no promises. It is built mostly with OpenAI's GPT5-Codex, as an experiment in creating a full application with AI agents._

Red Team Assessment Platform (RTAP) is built for internal Red Teams to plan and analyze their operations. The features and functionality are designed with their specific needs in mind, such as:

- Integrating the concept of threat actors and crown jewels into operations - who is being emulated, what is being targeted, and how is that trending over time?
- Producing visually appealing artifacts from individual operations, such as attack heatmaps, interactive flow charts, and timelines that allow the operator to design meaningful attack narratives.
- Tracking defensive outcomes in the context of full-scale Red Team operations - not just detection and prevention but also attribution, including log sources and timing.
- Deep integration into MITRE ATT&CK and STIX 2.1 standards - including importing attack campaigns and threat actor profiles directly from MITRE or from other STIX-based threat intelligence sources.
- RBAC with group restrictions, allowing teams to work on operation planning in stealth before providing visibility to other platform users.

## Contributing

This is still an early experiment, and I'm not ready for big contributions. I'd like to play around with it a bit more before deciding if it's useful and what shape it should take.

If you have an idea, or just want me to add something small, please open an issue first.

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for engineering standards.

## Security

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for information on reporting vulnerabilities.

## Tech Stack

Initially based on the T3 Stack - Next.js, tRPC, Prisma, TypeScript. Type-safe APIs, server-side rendering, and component-driven design.

Local development runs the Next.js dev server against a local PostgreSQL container. Production workloads also use Docker (web + Postgres) behind your own reverse proxy.

Authentication is all passwordless using NextAuth - with an option for passkeys and/or OAuth providers (initial support includes Google SSO).

## Licensing

The MITRE ATT&CK data included in this project is pulled directly from [their CTI project](https://github.com/mitre/cti), which requests the following statement be included:
